Vital signs like Heartbeat and Respiration rate are most commonly measured and monitored and this datais considered as primary vital sign information. 
To date, numerous devices are available in the market forvital sign monitoring like Electrocardiography (ECG), Phonocardiography, Pulse Oximetry etc. 
Most of these are contact methods which involves placing of some electrodes on the body surface that significantly limit the patient mobility and comfort, and are inconvenient for long-term monitoring.
Comfortis a top priority for consumer products; hence we go for non-contact approach.
Montoring technology is an ideal choice which is non-intrusive and can monitor vital signs from a distance by measuring mechanicalchest movements.
